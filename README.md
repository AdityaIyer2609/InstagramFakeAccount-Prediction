# InstagramFakeAccount-Prediction
Social media fake accounts and spam accounts have become a huge problem these days. Some had spammed me twice on Instagram. Here I have used Machine learning techniques to spot the fake/spam accounts. I used Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest Clasaifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the Spam account. In addition to these classification algorithms, I have tuned the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. Decision Tree overfitted the training data and My model achieved an accuracy of 90% on Validation data using RandomForest Classifier. There are a lot of fake IDs on Instagram and few spam pornographic content to the random people. On the top of it, Spammers do bully/harass people on social platforms. The intension of this sophisticated project is to find all those fake and spamming accounts and report them:)
